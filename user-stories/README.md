# User Stories - ALX Airbnb Project

This directory contains user stories derived from the use case diagram of the Airbnb Clone project.

The user stories capture the main system interactions from the perspective of different users (Guests, Hosts, and Admins).

## File:

- **user-stories.md**: Lists at least five key user stories outlining the goals and actions of users interacting with the system.

## Purpose:

User stories help guide the development process by providing clear and concise descriptions of user needs and system behavior.
